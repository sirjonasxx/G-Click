# G-Click

Clickthrough + advanced click recharger extension for G-Earth

> habbo has, in addition to the normal ratelimit, a second ratelimit system on the clicking mechanism causing the clicking to block off when you click more than 3 times in a row,  you can click like 3 times per 2.5 seconds
> 
> the second click-specific ratelimit system can be bypassed by clicking on a "use" item (for example: a fridge) because then, the ratelimiter resets. This is how click rechargers always worked and allow good players to click around 3-5 times consistently before blocking off
> 
> What G-Click does, is combining this bypass with a good internal scheduler to make optimal use of the normal ratelimit, allowing 10-18 clicks consistently
